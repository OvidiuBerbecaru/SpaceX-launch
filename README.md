The app uses a mock JWT token and a fake request in order to simulate the login process. Note that everytime you logout you get logged back in after a couple of seconds

The Dashboard is made up by a select filter that allows the user to filter the launches and an infinity scroll section that fetches the data in an optimised way and  displays it

### :arrow_forward: Data Card
It displays the following launch information:

:heavy_minus_sign: Name of the launch

:heavy_minus_sign: Date of the launch

:heavy_minus_sign: Type of the ship
